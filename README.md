# REACT HOOKS
Hooks are a new feature addition in React version 16.8 which allow you to use React features without having to write a class

## Important Rules to follow when using Hooks
1. Only call hooks at top level
ie Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested function

2. Only call hooks from react functions
ie Call them from within React functional components and not just any regular JavaScript function
